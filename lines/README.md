# lines lines lines

i wanted to start playing with linegraphs; of course, bostock already had the
[original inspiration](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3883245). this is mostly
just some basic line graphs, with a few extras:

* horizontal gridlines instead of a y-axis
* cynthia brewer colors, again
  [from a bostock block](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/5577023)
* me playing with an interesting hover effect
