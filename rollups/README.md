# rollups!

i have a specific need for a graph: i want a linegraph with a number of lines,
but i want an easy way to *group* the lines (i.e. aggregate the underlying
data). there's a nice article by bostock about
[object constancy](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/constancy/#key-functions) that
i've started reading as motivation.

this directory is currently just the linegraph example. because that was where
i needed to start.
